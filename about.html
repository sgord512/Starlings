<div class="post"><p>Hey, I'm Spencer Gordon. I'm originally from Los
	Angeles, though at the moment, I'm a sophmore going to college at
	Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. On this site, I have a
	blog, and I'm in the process of putting up some different projects
	I've worked on, and some of my writing from elsewhere. This site is
	very new at the moment, so I'm sure there are glitches all over the
	place, and I'd be happy to hear any feedback you might have.
