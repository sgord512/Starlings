TODO: 

- Update the list of posts, and make sure that the paragraph formatting isn't lost in the conversion from the giant wordpress dump
I fixed all the formatting stuff, so now I just need to do everything else. Easy peasy.

- Clean up the repo, so that I can have push work smoothly, and then generate the site on the server
Done. 

- Write some script that lets me save a text file, and then post it and have it show up on the site automatically, without any problems.

- Maybe set some way of adding posts on the website directly, through a javascript text editor, with some light MVC framework

- Write a script that can do all the redeployment needed. 

- Get some analytics in place. 

- Figure out some way of working email subscriptions into the mix
Ok, MailChimp can handle that

Also, I realize that I could totally easily deploy on Heroku, or Github Pages for free.

Tools I want to have access to:
- Rake
- HighLine
- Net-SSH
- Less

Ways to deploy: 
- Rsync
