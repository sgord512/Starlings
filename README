TODO: 

- Update the list of posts, and make sure that the paragraph formatting isn't lost in the conversion from the giant wordpress dump
I fixed all the formatting stuff, so now I just need to do everything else. Easy peasy.

- Write some script that lets me save a text file, and then post it and have it show up on the site automatically, without any problems.

- Write a script that can do all the redeployment needed. 

- Get some analytics in place. 

- Figure out some way of working email subscriptions into the mix
Ok, MailChimp can handle that

Also, I realize that I could totally easily deploy on Heroku, or Github Pages for free. 

So why am I using this Linode?
