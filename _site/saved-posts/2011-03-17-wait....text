"Bay of Pigs" is one of the best 11min songs I've heard in a while. Which reminds me. For some reason, I'd never actually listened CSNY, and I played "Suite: Judy Blue Eyes" a couple of times over the past week, and I really like it quite a bit. My favorite part is probably the end, which picks up the pace, switches to Spanish, and makes the rhythm awesome. I think this is one of those tracks that could be 10 times better with better production. I don't know what it is, but it feels a little thin, and distant at times. Listened again to the College Dropout, which is a stunning album, with about 8 or 9 songs that are stunningly good. His latest is in my todo list, and I imagine I'll eventually get to all of his stuff, though I really cannot stand the cover of _ Graduation _.
