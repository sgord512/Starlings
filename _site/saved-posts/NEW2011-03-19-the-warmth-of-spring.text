		So I'm feeling really good right now, as I get ready to go to sleep. I am feeling just very content, and right at home right now. I don't know what particularly is causing this, but I know I wouldn't rather be anywhere else right now. That's a rare feeling, and I'm afraid that if I stay up too long, I will somehow manage to screw it up. I'm gonna keep this short for that reason, and the only thing I want to say right now is: Goodnight, and I'll see you tomorrow. -
