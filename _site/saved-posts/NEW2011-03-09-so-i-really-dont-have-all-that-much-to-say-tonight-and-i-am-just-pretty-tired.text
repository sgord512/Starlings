		See above: One note: "Mayan Science" would be a great band name. Or, stolen from a friend, "Mayan Silence". Also, listen to Big Star, because "Thirteen" will break your heart, and "In the Street" will put you back together. Also, _ Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga _ by Spoon is awesome. "Don't Make Me a Target" is ridiculously awesome. Goodnight, And may you rest now so that in the morning you awake ready to face the day. -Spencer (or is that just my blog name?) (It is my actual name.) (But it won't be soon. Maybe. Probably it will be. I will give ample notice if I do change it later, so don't worry.)
