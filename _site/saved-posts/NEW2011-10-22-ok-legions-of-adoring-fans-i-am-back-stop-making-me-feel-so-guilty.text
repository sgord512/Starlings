				Ok, Legions of Adoring Fans, I Am Back, Stop Making Me Feel So Guilty
				</h3>
		<p>Yo, This is me. You know, Spencer. Your gregarious host for this enchanted evening. Nick Drake is playing on my puny laptop speakers, though I&#8217;m really thinking about Pere Ubu. Look them up, please, &#8216;cause they are awesome, awesome. Yeah, anyway, I&#8217;m back. I tried to quit, but the fans just kept clamoring out for more, and I can&#8217;t resist basking in the radiance of their love, a pure and unadulterated love much like that of someone who really loves someone else who they are in love with. But, because I have been on such a long hiatus, I&#8217;m afraid to report that I mostly have music-related stuff to talk about, mostly just bands that I haven&#8217;t had the chance to advocate for in the past couple of months, who I think need to be more widely known. But I will save that for the next post: Here&#8217;s something. I started writing a poem of sorts then got sidetracked and ended up with some inspirational quotes and a whole bunch of other junk. I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll do anything with it, but here is what I have so far: &gt; James Iry said that Philip Wadler said &#8220;a monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors, what&#8217;s the problem?&#8221; Morrissey said &#8220;I am the son, I am the heir / to a shyness that is criminally vulgar / I am the son and heir of nothing in particular&#8221; Elivs Costello said &#8221;I&#8217;m the town cryer, and everybody knows, I&#8217;m a little down with a lifetime to go.&#8221; W. B. Yeats said &#8220;The falcon cannot hear the falconer <span>..</span> The centre cannot hold&#8221; David Thomas said &#8221;I&#8217;ve got these arms and legs that flip-flop, flip-flop&#8221; Tanya Donelly said &#8220;Are there heartstrings connected / to the wings you got slapped on your back&#8221; Alan Perlis said all sorts of crazy shit, and then he died. Alonzo Church didn&#8217;t say much that I can remember I can&#8217;t remember what was said when I was still a kid Baruch de Spinoza said &#8220;I have striven not to laugh at human actions, not to weep at them, nor to hate them, but to understand them&#8221; Pete Doherty said &#8220;I get along&#8221; P = NP and it&#8217;s a Howling Wind indeed Kant said a lot of interesting stuff in awful, unreadable German Wittgenstein said &#8220;Philosophy is not a theory but an activity&#8221; and that &#8220;The real discovery of philosophy is the one which enables me to stop doing philosophy when I want to. The one that brings philosophy peace, so thtat it is no longer tormented by questions which bring itself into question&#8221; and that &#8220;There are remarks that sow and remarks the reap&#8221; William James said &#8220;Everybody should do things each day that he hates to do, just for practice&#8221; and &#8220;If any organism fails to fulfill its potentialities, it becomes sick&#8221; and &#8220;If you want a quality, act as if you already had it&#8221; and &#8220;The greatest weapon against strees is our ability to choose one thought over another&#8221; and &#8220;There is no more miserable human being than one in whom nothing is habitual but indecision&#8221; and &#8220;To change one&#8217;s life: Start immediately. Do it flamboyantly&#8221; David Foster Wallace said &#8220;I often think I can see in myself and in other young writers, teh desperate desire to please coupled with a kind of hostility to the reader&#8221; John Searle &#8220;Where questions of style and exposition are concerned I try to follow a simple maxim: if you can&#8217;t say it clearly you don&#8217;t understand it yourself&#8221; Feynman said &#8220;We can&#8217;t define anything precisely&#8221; Frege was agonizingly close to the truth, and even now you can&#8217;t help but be in awe of his accomplishments And that&#8217;s that. Goodnight Moon. Goodnight Stars. Goodnight.</p>
