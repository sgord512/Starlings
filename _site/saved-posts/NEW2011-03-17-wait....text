		<p>So I just listened to <em>Kaputt</em> by Destroyer, which is a really solid album, with some truly remarkable songs. &#8220;Bay of Pigs&#8221; is one of the best 11min songs I&#8217;ve heard in a while. Which reminds me. For some reason, I&#8217;d never actually listened CSNY, and I played &#8220;Suite: Judy Blue Eyes&#8221; a couple of times over the past week, and I really like it quite a bit. My favorite part is probably the end, which picks up the pace, switches to Spanish, and makes the rhythm awesome. I think this is one of those tracks that could be 10 times better with better production. I don&#8217;t know what it is, but it feels a little thin, and distant at times. Listened again to the College Dropout, which is a stunning album, with about 8 or 9 songs that are stunningly good. His latest is in my todo list, and I imagine I&#8217;ll eventually get to all of his stuff, though I really cannot stand the cover of _ Graduation <em>.</em></p>
