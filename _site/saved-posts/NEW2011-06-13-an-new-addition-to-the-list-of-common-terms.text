		<p>I am in the process of pyschoanalyzing myself. This is turning out to be very difficult, and the times when I actually achieve an insight are few and far between. The problem is, I am trying to answer the question, &#8220;How am I thinking and feeling?&#8221;, and that&#8217;s close enough to a fish trying to learn about water to make me wonder if it&#8217;s worth the effort to keep trying to get the bottom of things. But so far I&#8217;ve kept it up, mostly because I want more than anything else to get myself in order, get myself facing forward, standing tall on my feet, eyes gazing in front of me. And whenever I get frustrated I wonder if maybe I&#8217;m trying too hard, if maybe all I need is to give up trying to change anything, and resign myself to my fate, whatever that may be. But I don&#8217;t know if I can do that, and I don&#8217;t want to not want to be different. I don&#8217;t want to be happy with myself as I am. I want to want to be better. I want to always be the most I can be. I don&#8217;t want to let any potential go unfulfilled. I forget who it was that said that he didn&#8217;t want to arrive at the end of life in good condition. He wanted to end up battered and bruised, and taken for a ride, cause if he only gets one chance, why not make the most of it. This makes sense, I guess, but I know that I can&#8217;t do this, the way I want to. The way I want to. Anyway, here&#8217;s a concept that I think I am adding to my list of concepts that I will use to understand my life: RAM, an apt term for me at this time, as I delve deeper and deeper into the field of computer science, finding myself in waters of increasing darkness, far from the surface, and without a path to guide me. The idea came to me, as I decided to shut all of the 50 or so Firefox tabs that had been accumulating over the past couple weeks. I had been reluctant to close them for the longest time, as they all were things I wanted to read, or look into further. But today, after a day spent wasting time, feeling like shit, and desperate to get out of this malaise, I just got rid of all of them. I realized that I was feeling so bad in part, because of all the stuff that I was trying to keep in my mind, all of the thoughts that I wasnt pausing before completion, because I wanted to do other things first. I just need to decrease the amount of stuff I am thinking about, becuase I was using so much of my attention just trying to manage the things that I wanted to focus on, that I couldn&#8217;t really focus on any one thing. I need to work on this. Like I had a whole bunch of goals I had assigned myself in the social sphere that I had been holding off on, because I had been telling myself that I needed to reflect more on them, and that I had other higher priorities for the present. Last night&#8217;s post was one of my worst ever, and I think the reason for that is that I was literally so full of shit to think about that I couldn&#8217;t go anywhere. So I&#8217;m throwing shit out now, getting my head all clear and focused. I am paring down, cutting off the fat, tapering my light from a wide cone to a single bright point. Like a laser, I will burn a hole through a wall, I will bore down into the earth. But this means that I will actually want to right now go get some things resolved. So I&#8217;m going to post this now, and when I have finished with the other stuff come back to post here again, done for the night. -Spencer</p>
