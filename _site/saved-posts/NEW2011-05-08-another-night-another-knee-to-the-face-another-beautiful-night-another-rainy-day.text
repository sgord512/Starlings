		So, As the title of this post may suggest, I am alternately feeling good and bad, and I know that those are the most generic descriptions possible, but I chose them, because that is all I mean to say. I don't want to say any more. I know why, and I know why. Tomorrow is another day, and I will try again tomorrow. Starting fresh, not feeling so very heavy anymore. Right now, my whole body wants to drop to the floor. My whole soul slides towards sleep. I am asleep. -Sssssss
