		<p>Oh solipsism, my friend, how good it is to see you again. I had some really class quote that I was going to use up there in that first sentence, but then I forgot it, but then I remembered it about 3 words ago. And here it is &#8220;Hello darkness, my old friend, I&#8217;ve come to talk with you again.&#8221; I was going to replace &#8220;darkness&#8221; with &#8220;solipsism&#8221;, because that way I am not forced to think about the meanings of the things I am saying, instead trafficking in the particulate matter of common culture that has slowly accumulated on every exposed surface in my life. There, I used a simile that subtly transitioned into a metaphor. Wow, I&#8217;m brilliant. (Just to be clear, I am being sarcastic there. Nevertheless, I am not saying that I am not brilliant, just not commenting either way. It&#8217;s up to you to decide.) Uggghhh, I&#8217;m even annoying myself right now. I wish I knew how to get myself out of bad moods. Currently, the best I can do is &#8220;Spencer, you&#8217;ll get over it, and don&#8217;t let yourself make more out of it than you need to, because this happens all the time. It means nothing.&#8221; It is not so bad, but I wish there was something I could do besides wait it out. Ugghhhh. I should probably do the homework that I am writing this post to avoid. Will I? I don&#8217;t know anymore. Goodnight Moon. Good Day Sunshine. A slip of the tongue, slipping slowly soaking in sweet sibilance.</p>
