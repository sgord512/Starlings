		<p>Interesting things: I just finished reading <em>The Most Human Human</em> by Brian Christian, a Brown alum who is actually coming to campus tomorrow to talk about his work, along with two other alumni who are also creative non-fiction authors. I&#8217;m excited. He&#8217;s also basically the same person as me: Comp Sci. / Philosophy dual-concentrator, with interests in the humanities as well. Both of us are interested in writing, particularly creative nonfiction. One awesome thing in the book: A couple of times he quotes from &#8220;Brown University Professor Bernard Reginster&#8221; who I am actually taking a class with right now. He also mentions CS Professor Eugene Charniak, who I know by name, though I haven&#8217;t taken anything with him yet. He also mentions a CS theory course he took senior year, which may be the course I am taking right now. It&#8217;s awesome, a really quick read, and quite thought-provoking. It&#8217;s the kind of book you want to keep around for the bibliography alone. I&#8217;ve been on a roll, reading-wise recently, just yesterday finishing Alan Watt&#8217;s <em>The Book - On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are</em>, which was pretty interesting, though I&#8217;ve not yet digested it. I&#8217;ll render a verdict later, when I&#8217;ve had more time to consider it. (I just checked out his <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Watts'>page on wikipedia</a>, which is pretty interesting. Also has a fantastic photograph of him; I don&#8217;t know why I like it so much, but I love that photo.) That&#8217;s it for now, and goodnight. -Spencer</p>
