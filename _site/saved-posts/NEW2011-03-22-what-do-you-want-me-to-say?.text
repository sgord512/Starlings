				What do you want me to say?
				</h3>
		<p>There&#8217;s a great line in a Dismemberment Plan song, something like, &#8220;What do you want me to say to let you know that I still love you&#8221;. What may sound flat on the page sears in the song, as Travis half screams, half begs to know how to make his lover understand him. Or something like that. A lot of lyrics I like are not particularly complex, but they are sentiments that are rarely found in pop music, articulated clearly, sentiments which I myself have had, but have failed to articulate. Others are particularly evocative images, or exceedingly clever and simultaneously true. I don&#8217;t like clever that seems to be devoid of meaning, though I&#8217;m not actually sure when I think about it what that would look like. I&#8217;ll come back to this post a little later, and add to it.</p>
