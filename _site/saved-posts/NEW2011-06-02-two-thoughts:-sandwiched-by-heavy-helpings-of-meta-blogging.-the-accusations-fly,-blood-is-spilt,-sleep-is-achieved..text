		Hello, I spent so much time coming up with the title for this post that I kinda forgot what I had planned for the content. Here's what I do remember: First, I was going to worry out loud about the frequency of posting, so as to make myself feel less guilty for spamming the inboxen of my readers, without whomse (I compromised between the two equally wrong sounding choices of whose and whom) loving care and support I would be merely a hollow shell of a blogger, devoid of passion, insight, or other things which make one more than a hollow shell of a blogger. And the other route I had mapped out for this post? Well, basically, so I sent a message to someone, and received a message that was longer and more intimate in tone than my opening move. Well, inspired and emboldened by this seeming honesty and intimacy, I added a third message in which I accepted the subtle offer to move the conversation in a deeper direction, responding at the same level of intimacy and openness I was received with. My message was longer, continuing a chain unbroken of messages of increasing length, monotonic, for those of you who enjoy using mathematical and technical words in contexts where they don't exactly apply yet could be defended reasonably on the basis of being the mathematical analogue to an informal concept. Anyway the response I received was shorter than mine. That felt bad. I know it shouldn't. I should fix that.
