				<h3>
				Deeper into Music
				</h3>
		<p>So I&#8217;ve been getting deeper into music. I&#8217;ve been rapidly absorbing new genres and artists, and I think I&#8217;ve reached a new stage in my music appreciation adventure. I&#8217;ve begun to notice more stuff in the music I do listen to, and I now am able to pay attention to songwriting in a way that I hadn&#8217;t before. I don&#8217;t have the ear yet to describe what I am picking up on in music theoretical terms, but I am noticing certain patterns, certain shapes that characterize certain artists. Paul Simon has a songwriting style that I think is very distinctive, for example. His best songs all are very gentle-feeling, with these winding vocal melodies that never feature dramatic shifts in emotion. I&#8217;ve been listening to <em>There Goes Rhymin&#8217; Simon</em> which is a masterpiece of an album. Pretty much every song is a gem, a carefully constructed, carefully orchestrated story. It&#8217;s hard to think of a single song that doesn&#8217;t hold up all that well, and the only one that comes to mind is &#8220;Was a Sunny Day&#8221;, and I think it&#8217;s good, just not maybe as good as the rest. I&#8217;ll say more later, but I&#8217;m tired, and hopefully this post will get me back into blogging. So I&#8217;m gonna call it quits for the night. -Spencer</p>
