	Serenity Prayer

		I really like the serenity prayer. I think it is a wonderful sentiment, expressed concisely. For those of you who don't know it (though you might know it, not by name), here is the most common version, according to wikipedia: > God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change; courage to change the things I can; and wisdom to know the difference. Goodnight, Reporting across vast reaches of silent space, across a sky of shimmering stars, I transmit through a thread woven into the endless blanket that keeps us all warm, Spencer.
