				How do you debug the world, I don't know.
				</h2>
		I am in the middle of a project that requires substantial debugging. I don't enjoy doing it. I don't know how to handle it very well. I don't know how to handle it at all really. Anyway, a day later I am sitting here, listening to _Summerteeth_, an absolutely gorgeous album that I instantly recommend to all human beings. That's all for now, and now the day later, I am finishing the post I started a long time ago. This is taking forever, and I don't have much of a good reason, and I am a little bit frustrated by it. I am now going to figure this out. Actually, I'm just going to post this, because this is going nowhere, and I know that if I force myself to keep writing, I am just going to get more irritated, and I won't like whatever it is that I end up writing. So goodbye for now, and I'll try and post later tonight, when I actually have something to say. -Spencer
