				How do you debug the world, I don't know.
				</h3>
		<p>I am in the middle of a project that requires substantial debugging. I don&#8217;t enjoy doing it. I don&#8217;t know how to handle it very well. I don&#8217;t know how to handle it at all really. Anyway, a day later I am sitting here, listening to <em>Summerteeth</em>, an absolutely gorgeous album that I instantly recommend to all human beings. That&#8217;s all for now, and now the day later, I am finishing the post I started a long time ago. This is taking forever, and I don&#8217;t have much of a good reason, and I am a little bit frustrated by it. I am now going to figure this out. Actually, I&#8217;m just going to post this, because this is going nowhere, and I know that if I force myself to keep writing, I am just going to get more irritated, and I won&#8217;t like whatever it is that I end up writing. So goodbye for now, and I&#8217;ll try and post later tonight, when I actually have something to say. -Spencer</p>
