<h3>11/09/11 - Can't Hardly Wait</h3>
</div>
<h6><a href="/2011/11/09/cant-hardly-wait.html">permalink</a></h6>	
<p><p>Interesting things: I just finished reading <em>The Most Human Human</em> by Brian Christian, a Brown alum who is actually coming to campus tomorrow to talk about his work, along with two other alumni who are also creative non-fiction authors. I&#8217;m excited. He&#8217;s also basically the same person as me: Comp Sci. / Philosophy dual-concentrator, with interests in the humanities as well. Both of us are interested in writing, particularly creative nonfiction. One awesome thing in the book: A couple of times he quotes from &#8220;Brown University Professor Bernard Reginster&#8221; who I am actually taking a class with right now. He also mentions CS Professor Eugene Charniak, who I know by name, though I haven&#8217;t taken anything with him yet. He also mentions a CS theory course he took senior year, which may be the course I am taking right now. It&#8217;s awesome, a really quick read, and quite thought-provoking. It&#8217;s the kind of book you want to keep around for the bibliography alone. I&#8217;ve been on a roll, reading-wise recently, just yesterday finishing Alan Watt&#8217;s <em>The Book - On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are</em>, which was pretty interesting, though I&#8217;ve not yet digested it. I&#8217;ll render a verdict later, when I&#8217;ve had more time to consider it. (I just checked out his <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Watts'>page on wikipedia</a>, which is pretty interesting. Also has a fantastic photograph of him; I don&#8217;t know why I like it so much, but I love that photo.) That&#8217;s it for now, and goodnight. -Spencer</p></p>

<h3>11/06/11 - I'm beginning to see the light</h3>
</div>
<h6><a href="/2011/11/06/im-beginning-to-see-the-light.html">permalink</a></h6>	
<p><p>I woke up early this morning, was out of bed at 7am. Tried to go to breakfast, realized the dining halls were all closed, returned to my room, and tried to figure out what to do for the next three and a half hours. I thought about doing homework, but I looked at the problem sets I had, and didn&#8217;t feel like doing them at the time. So I decided to work on my website project, and I started doing that. In accordance with my way of doing things, I&#8217;m getting way too hardcore about this site. My original goal was to get total control over the content of my website, and I thought I could somehow just generate a folder of static pages that I could upload somewhere, in order to actually deploy. And there probably is a way to do just that, but at some point in my research I rejected that approach for whatever reason, and my new approach is to control every aspect of the web hosting/development/deployment/whatever process, and it is turning out to be quite an involved and annoying process, and I&#8217;m having to get into all sorts of arcana that offends my self-image as a big-picture-kind-of-guy. But it&#8217;s too late to stop now. Analogy: It&#8217;s like I&#8217;ve opened Pandora&#8217;s box, and now I have to catalog every goddamn one of the creatures that swarmed forth, and I have to know their whole fucking ecology, and I have to make sure I don&#8217;t get bitten in the process. To bring this back down to earth (as if the layers upon layers of software abstractions are any more concrete), I&#8217;m renting a machine running Ubuntu 10.04 in a datacenter in Newark, NJ. I&#8217;ve spent the last couple hours SSH&#8217;ing into that box (nicknamed spinoza), installing a whole bunch of random packages (emacs, git, apache, etc.), so that I can later run my server on it. I also bought some domain names, which I&#8217;ll have to separately hook up to the IP of the server. As for the site itself, I&#8217;m writing a ruby script to generate the site from a whole bunch of post files written in markdown, and some template files. I&#8217;m also using the <a href='http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/'>twitter/bootstrap</a> css/javascript/html toolkit, which makes everything really professional looking, but which I have to customize to get working in the way I would like. Isn&#8217;t this exciting. Change of topic: <em>The Velvet Underground and Nico</em> is really an incredible album, and I seem to have a new favorite track every time I listen. Recently, it&#8217;s been &#8220;The Black Angel&#8217;s Death Song&#8221;, a spoken-word ramble surrounded by a swarm of eerie violin and tape hisses and clicks. In it, you can totally see the prototype for &#8220;Murder Mystery&#8221; on <em>The Velvet Underground</em> another of my favorite tracks. The lyrics are utterly insane, and I love it: &gt; &#8220;Candy screen wrappers of silkscreen fantastic, requiring memories, both lovely and guiltfree, lurid and lovely with twilight of ages, luscious and lovely and filthy with laghter, laconic giggles, ennui fort the passions, in order to justify most spurious desires, rectify moments, most serious and urgent, to hail upon the face of most odious time, requiring replies most facile and vacuous, with words nearly singed, with the heartbeat of passions, spew forth with the grace of a tart going under, subject of great concern, noble origin Denigrate obtuse and active verbs pronouns, skewer the sieve of optical sewer, release the handle that holds all the gates up, puncture the eyeballls, that seep all the muck up, read all the books and he people worth reading and still see the muck on the sky of the ceiling Please raise the flag rosy red carpet envy english used here is messenger is nervous it&#8217;s no fun at all out here in the hall Mister moonlight succulent smooth and gorgeous.

<p><p>Hey, this is gonna be a pretty short post, as I&#8217;m on my way to sleep soon, and I don&#8217;t have all that much to say. I&#8217;ve finally made some real progress on getting my revamped site together, and I should be able to get it up and running within a couple of weeks. Or maybe even something more reasonable than that. Whatever. Anyway, the title of the post comes from the song &#8220;Chivalry&#8221; by the Mekons on <em>Fear and Whiskey</em>, which is a fantastic album. Other good stuff I&#8217;ve been listening to recently: The Robert Cray Band&#8217;s <em>Strong Persuader</em>, Girls&#8217; <em>Album</em>, Pere Ubu&#8217;s <em>Dub Housing</em>, Sleater-Kinney&#8217;s <em>Call the Doctor</em>, and Archers of Loaf&#8217;s <em>Icky Mettle</em>. I cannot believe how much incredible music is out there, just waiting for someone to listen to it. Oh, and Aztec Camera&#8217;s <em>High Land, Hard Rain</em>, which I&#8217;m not sure about. I have to give it some more time before rendering my verdict. Did you know Bertrand Russell invented Type Theory like 40 years before it was explored in the context of programming languages. Now I&#8217;m going to sleep, so goodnight moon. Goodnight, stars. Goodnight, Mars. Goodnight, folks. -Spencer</p></p>

<p><p>Hey, The blitzkrieg is over. An uneasy truce. You wouldn&#8217;t believe the things that have happened, the wispy breeze of experience, the sudden blinding as you turn and are faced with the white hot reflection of the sun in the polished metal surface of a sedan. Blitzkrieg Bop. They are generating steam heat. From a whisper to a scream. Dub Housing. Navvy. Caligari&#8217;s Mirror. Yeah, that is me free-associating. Except for that last line, which is me trying to get you to check out Pere Ubu&#8217;s <em>Dub Housing</em>, which is an utterly insane album that I am falling in love with. News: My weekend mostly sucked, and I&#8217;m sleep deprived, and I am waiting on an email from a TA to tell me whether or not I have more work to do. If I do, I might just not do it, and go to sleep anyway. If I don&#8217;t, then all the better. I&#8217;ve been loving the music I&#8217;ve been listening to, and that&#8217;s something. I&#8217;m having trouble figuring out how much I want to share on this blog again, and I am going to err on the side of undersharing at the moment. Uggghhhh. Anyway, my phone should be arriving in the mail tomorrow, and with any luck, my life can return to normal phone-wise. I cannot express in words the degree to which I hate my current phone. Whatever you are imagining me to mean, I promise you that you do not grasp the full depth of my hatred for this infernal device. But that is not really the most exciting topic, so I&#8217;m going to stop talking about that. Weather is good these days, though it is getting dark really early. I imagine it will continue to get darker earlier and earlier until the end of Daylight Savings Time on November 6th. I just googled that, &#8216;cause I had no idea when the switch was. Whatever. Last word this evening: Soporific</p></p>
