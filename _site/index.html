<h3>12/23/11 - Recursively Enumerable/ Turing-Recognizable</h3>

<div class="toggle"><p>I can&#8217;t seem to figure out what&#8217;s behind my absurd traffic on the blog.</p>

<p>Example: two days ago I had 10 hits, which might not seem like a lot, but given that my all-time high is 11 on a day, I was pretty jazzed. The next day, though, I had exactly 0 hits. Weird stuff.</p>

<p>I just got through finals, think they all went well. Anyway, now I&#8217;m faced with more free time than I know what to do with, and I&#8217;m not exaggerating in the slightest.</p>

<p>I need some absurdly over-ambitious goal to achieve, or else I&#8217;ll be bored out of my mind.</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;- (1 day later) &#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>

<p>I have some ideas. I&#8217;ll let you know how they go.</p>

<h3>12/18/11 - The Aetiology of Tristesse</h3>
</div>
<h6><a href="/2011/12/18/the-aetiology-of-tristesse.html">permalink</a></h6>	
<div class="toggle"><p>Well, the semester is pulling to a close, with a whimper. I suppose that is how things go.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m tired of not getting mathematical logic, and I&#8217;ve given myself the insane and probably unrealistic goal of working through all the exercises in Warren Goldfarb&#8217;s <em>Deductive Logic</em> over break. I&#8217;m tired of not being able to understand with all the technicality Gödel&#8217;s Incompleteness Theorems.</p>

<p>New finds:</p>

<p><em>How Will The Wolf Survive?</em> - Los Lobos</p>

<p><em>Heyday</em> - The Church</p>

<p>That last post was a draft that I never published, so I just published it then, and it didn&#8217;t count. That&#8217;s my excuse for posting twice in a day.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m getting really interested in Dummett and Wittgenstein, Sellars, Pierce, Schopenhauer. But I always have more than enough to read.</p>

<p>Gonna try and finally read the entirety of the <em>Cryptonomicon</em> as well. Also wanna read <em>The Year of Magical Thinking</em>, <em>The Stranger</em>, and something by Dostoyevsky, probably <em>Notes from the Underground</em>. Other plans include starting my own programming language, getting my website fully operational, punching holes in walls, tipping vending machines over, crying alone in a canoe, spinning until I throw up, reading Kripke, naturalizing epistemology, metaphysics, and your mom.</p>

<p>It would be an exaggeration to say that I am having a nervous breakdown right now, but I think it would to be call it a nervy stutter, a swampy mutter.</p>

<p>I have been angry recently, a feeling which I&#8217;d forgotten for a while, and which is unfamiliar, uncomfortable, and a little bit more fun than I&#8217;d remembered. It feels good to swell with righteous anger, at least until your bubble bursts, at which point you just feel stupid, and wallow in self-pity.</p>

<p>My body is tired. My mind is tired. I&#8217;m gonna go to sleep. Australian singers sound great. The accent is transformed into this endlessly elegant, rich, boundlessly wise voice.</p>

<p>Also: <em>Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness</em> - Smashing Pumpkins</p>

<p>At 28 tracks it is huge, and bloated, but you&#8217;d be surprised at how much of it holds up really well.</p>

<p>D. W. Winnicott makes a lot of sense, and his junk has the ring of truth. Same with Heinz Kohut.</p>

<p>Plums and paper. Scrambling, babbling lease on life. Pillow fights. Younger the Elder. Cato, and Brueghel. The Dakotas.</p>

<p>Finished <em>The Deptford Trilogy</em> for the second time yesterday. Just as good as I&#8217;d remembered, or better. A wonderful world you hate to leave.</p>

<p>-Spencer</p>

<p>It&#8217;s getting cold, someone said 20s today, but I didn&#8217;t check. No snow, don&#8217;t think there&#8217;ll be any before I&#8217;m back in the City of Angles. (Not a typo) (Maybe a pun) Whatever.</p></div>

<h3>12/18/11 - Don't Ask Me Questions</h3>
</div>
<h6><a href="/2011/12/18/dont-ask-me-questions.html">permalink</a></h6>	
<div class="toggle"><p>I&#8217;m a sucker for a well-done expression of pure, unadulterated rage. Found a new one today: by Graham Parker &#38; The Rumour, &#8220;Don&#8217;t Ask Me Questions&#8221;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Crimson autograph is what we leave behind</p>

<p>Everywhere man set foot.</p>

<p>War mongers laughing loud behind a painted face</p>

<p>Throwing titbits to the crowd then blowing up the place.</p>

<p>Hey Lord don&#8217;t ask me questions, Hey Lord don&#8217;t ask me questions</p>

<p>Hey Lord don&#8217;t ask me questions please!</p>

<p>Hey Lord don&#8217;t ask me questions, Hey Lord don&#8217;t ask me questions</p>

<p>Hey Lord ain&#8217;t no answer in me. (Solo)</p>

<p>Well I stand up for liberty but can&#8217;t liberate</p>

<p>Pent up agony I see you take first place.</p>

<p>Well who does this treachery I shout with bleeding hand</p>

<p>Is it you or is it me well I never will understand.</p>

<p>Hey Lord don&#8217;t ask me questions, Hey Lord don&#8217;t ask me questions</p>

<p>Hey Lord don&#8217;t ask me questions please!</p>

<p>Hey Lord don&#8217;t ask me questions, Hey Lord don&#8217;t ask me questions</p>

<p>Hey Lord ain&#8217;t no answer in me. (Solo)</p>

<p>Well I see the thousands screaming rushing for the cliffs</p>

<p>Just like lemmings into the sea, Well well well</p>

<p>Who waves his mighty hand and breaks the precious rules?</p>

<p>Well the same one must understand who wasted all these fools.</p>

<p>Hey Lord don&#8217;t ask me questions, Hey Lord don&#8217;t ask me questions</p>

<p>Hey Lord don&#8217;t ask me questions please!</p>

<p>Hey Lord don&#8217;t ask me questions, Hey Lord don&#8217;t ask me questions</p>

<p>Hey Lord ain&#8217;t no answer in me. (Solo)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, like everything ever by Titus Andronicus.</p></div>

<h3>12/11/11 - We Walk</h3>
</div>
<h6><a href="/2011/12/11/we-walk.html">permalink</a></h6>	
<div class="toggle"><p>I&#8217;m in the basement of the library, the only floor on which I could find an empty desk. I&#8217;ve been here for about two hours now, reading like 80 pages of Ronald Fairbairn, on Object Relations theory. Now, I&#8217;m procrastinating with this post, and I&#8217;ll soon move on to the task of summarizing some Gottlob Frege for my Philosophy of Mathematics final on Tuesday. I&#8217;m listening to Graham Parker and the Rumour&#8217;s <em>Howling Wind</em>, an album which I liked at first, but which keeps rising in my estimation, and is now in my top ten albums of the year. It is pretty much perfect, and I&#8217;ve thought at least three or four different tracks were my favorite already, which invariably happens with albums that I go on to fall in love with.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m getting into Australian rock, mostly through the Church&#8217;s <em>Heyday</em>, which is a remarkable album. I should get to Frege now, so that&#8217;s it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll post sometime later this weekend probably.</p>

<h3>12/08/11 - American Squirm</h3>
</div>
<h6><a href="/2011/12/08/american-squirm.html">permalink</a></h6>	
<div class="toggle"><p>I couldn&#8217;t get to sleep last night. Was in bed at 2am, tossed for ~1hour before giving up and getting out of bed. I decided to read until I was tired, and then try again. At 3:30am I gave it another shot, but no luck, and at 4:30 I got out of bed again. More reading. At 6am I find myself mind awake, and decide to admit defeat, and spend my newfound free time productively. So I walked a mile to my barber of choice, a grumpy Eastside fixture who still does straight-razor shaves, and opens his place at 6am sharp every weekday.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a super abstract method I&#8217;ve realized I use when I produce my best writing: The basic idea is to keep switching up the distance from which you are considering the work. So, if I&#8217;m writing an essay, I write a paragraph, trying to make a specific point, without worrying about how it fits into the context of the rest of the piece. I then step back and consider it structurally. I then look at sentences. I keep changing perspectives, thinking about the piece of at all all different levels.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve come to believe that one of the markers of great art is that it works on many different levels. A great novel has interesting sentences, interesting paragraphs, interesting chapters, etc&#8230; This theory accounts for my lukewarm reaction to cheap thrillers and stuff like <em>Of Mice and Men</em>. Both of them are concerned with the larger units of meaning, and at the sentence level, there&#8217;s none of the complexity and artfulness that may be present in the plot as a whole. You have to kinda read them and ignore the lower-level writing in anticipation of the higher-level payoff. On the other hand, a truly great work is compelling on all scales, and as a result, you don&#8217;t have to direct your attention to a specific aspect, but can instead let yourself just experience the work freely moving between sentences and chapters, paragraphs, and plots. That&#8217;s the theory. I might elaborate later.</p>

<p>Also, didn&#8217;t mention it at the time, but the last post was my 100th!. This is 101. So there.</p>
