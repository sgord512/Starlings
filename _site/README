Ok, so I have a pretty solid layout in place. It's super customizable, and really pretty.

I now want to write a ruby script that uses Kramdown to generate HTML from Markdown, and I can then do my own super-simple static site generator.

COMPLETED:
I can now parse posts in Markdown, and pop them into HTML with liquid templating
I now have a script that will create the requisite folder for that

TODO:
Add metadata, and figure out how to extract it, and put it on the page correctly

Compile all the posts for a 'recent posts'-type thing

Get the css working even better


I have it under git, so it can be all be nicely version-controlled.

I can use less to generate CSS.

So my next step is to figure out how I want to organize posts, and how I want to have them before site generation.

(Probably markdown, and I will do something like YAML front-matter for meta-data)
