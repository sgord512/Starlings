		<p>Well, the semester is pulling to a close, with a whimper. I suppose that is how things go.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m tired of not getting mathematical logic, and I&#8217;ve given myself the insane and probably unrealistic goal of working through all the exercises in Warren Goldfarb&#8217;s <em>Deductive Logic</em> over break. I&#8217;m tired of not being able to understand with all the technicality Gödel&#8217;s Incompleteness Theorems.</p>

<p>New finds:</p>

<p><em>How Will The Wolf Survive?</em> - Los Lobos</p>

<p><em>Heyday</em> - The Church</p>

<p>That last post was a draft that I never published, so I just published it then, and it didn&#8217;t count. That&#8217;s my excuse for posting twice in a day.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m getting really interested in Dummett and Wittgenstein, Sellars, Pierce, Schopenhauer. But I always have more than enough to read.</p>

<p>Gonna try and finally read the entirety of the <em>Cryptonomicon</em> as well. Also wanna read <em>The Year of Magical Thinking</em>, <em>The Stranger</em>, and something by Dostoyevsky, probably <em>Notes from the Underground</em>. Other plans include starting my own programming language, getting my website fully operational, punching holes in walls, tipping vending machines over, crying alone in a canoe, spinning until I throw up, reading Kripke, naturalizing epistemology, metaphysics, and your mom.</p>

<p>It would be an exaggeration to say that I am having a nervous breakdown right now, but I think it would to be call it a nervy stutter, a swampy mutter.</p>

<p>I have been angry recently, a feeling which I&#8217;d forgotten for a while, and which is unfamiliar, uncomfortable, and a little bit more fun than I&#8217;d remembered. It feels good to swell with righteous anger, at least until your bubble bursts, at which point you just feel stupid, and wallow in self-pity.</p>

<p>My body is tired. My mind is tired. I&#8217;m gonna go to sleep. Australian singers sound great. The accent is transformed into this endlessly elegant, rich, boundlessly wise voice.</p>

<p>Also: <em>Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness</em> - Smashing Pumpkins</p>

<p>At 28 tracks it is huge, and bloated, but you&#8217;d be surprised at how much of it holds up really well.</p>

<p>D. W. Winnicott makes a lot of sense, and his junk has the ring of truth. Same with Heinz Kohut.</p>

<p>Plums and paper. Scrambling, babbling lease on life. Pillow fights. Younger the Elder. Cato, and Brueghel. The Dakotas.</p>

<p>Finished <em>The Deptford Trilogy</em> for the second time yesterday. Just as good as I&#8217;d remembered, or better. A wonderful world you hate to leave.</p>

<p>-Spencer</p>

<p>It&#8217;s getting cold, someone said 20s today, but I didn&#8217;t check. No snow, don&#8217;t think there&#8217;ll be any before I&#8217;m back in the City of Angles. (Not a typo) (Maybe a pun) Whatever.</p>
