		<p>I couldn&#8217;t get to sleep last night. Was in bed at 2am, tossed for ~1hour before giving up and getting out of bed. I decided to read until I was tired, and then try again. At 3:30am I gave it another shot, but no luck, and at 4:30 I got out of bed again. More reading. At 6am I find myself mind awake, and decide to admit defeat, and spend my newfound free time productively. So I walked a mile to my barber of choice, a grumpy Eastside fixture who still does straight-razor shaves, and opens his place at 6am sharp every weekday.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a super abstract method I&#8217;ve realized I use when I produce my best writing: The basic idea is to keep switching up the distance from which you are considering the work. So, if I&#8217;m writing an essay, I write a paragraph, trying to make a specific point, without worrying about how it fits into the context of the rest of the piece. I then step back and consider it structurally. I then look at sentences. I keep changing perspectives, thinking about the piece of at all all different levels.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve come to believe that one of the markers of great art is that it works on many different levels. A great novel has interesting sentences, interesting paragraphs, interesting chapters, etc&#8230; This theory accounts for my lukewarm reaction to cheap thrillers and stuff like <em>Of Mice and Men</em>. Both of them are concerned with the larger units of meaning, and at the sentence level, there&#8217;s none of the complexity and artfulness that may be present in the plot as a whole. You have to kinda read them and ignore the lower-level writing in anticipation of the higher-level payoff. On the other hand, a truly great work is compelling on all scales, and as a result, you don&#8217;t have to direct your attention to a specific aspect, but can instead let yourself just experience the work freely moving between sentences and chapters, paragraphs, and plots. That&#8217;s the theory. I might elaborate later.</p>

<p>Also, didn&#8217;t mention it at the time, but the last post was my 100th!. This is 101. So there.</p>
