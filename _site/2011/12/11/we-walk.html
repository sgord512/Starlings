		<p>I&#8217;m in the basement of the library, the only floor on which I could find an empty desk. I&#8217;ve been here for about two hours now, reading like 80 pages of Ronald Fairbairn, on Object Relations theory. Now, I&#8217;m procrastinating with this post, and I&#8217;ll soon move on to the task of summarizing some Gottlob Frege for my Philosophy of Mathematics final on Tuesday. I&#8217;m listening to Graham Parker and the Rumour&#8217;s <em>Howling Wind</em>, an album which I liked at first, but which keeps rising in my estimation, and is now in my top ten albums of the year. It is pretty much perfect, and I&#8217;ve thought at least three or four different tracks were my favorite already, which invariably happens with albums that I go on to fall in love with.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m getting into Australian rock, mostly through the Church&#8217;s <em>Heyday</em>, which is a remarkable album. I should get to Frege now, so that&#8217;s it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll post sometime later this weekend probably.</p>
