		<p>So usually I have to get to &#8220;Fuck it!&#8221; from a sense of righteous anger, a sense that I am a human being, and I deserve nothing less than what any other human being deserves.</p>

<p>This works fine, but it leaves a bad taste in my mouth, and makes it hard to genuinely not care, because I am daring myself to let their opinions matter, as opposed to just simply not thinking about them at all.</p>

<p>About 10 minutes after I published that last post, a song made me remember the other way I can come to that same conclusion. The song: &#8220;In &#38; Out in Paris &#38; London&#8221; by The Divine Comedy. The lyrics are awesome, and really sarcastic:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is a far far better thing that I do now than I have ever done before</p>

<p>It is a far far better place that I go to than I have ever known before&#8221;</p>

<p>My slap &#8216;n&#8217; tickle made her giggle</p>

<p>Made her wiggle like a willow tree</p>

<p>So suggestively</p>

<p>So I suggested</p>

<p>She protested</p>

<p>I persisted till she said &#8220;Well, okay&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>And I said &#8220;Wey-hey!&#8221;</p>

<p>In or out—of one thing there can be no doubt</p>

<p>Out or in—this is not a sin—it&#8217;s not even original!</p>

<p>And hey, we&#8217;re all individuals—so let the games begin!</p>

<p>I fall in love with someone new practically every day but that&#8217;s okay</p>

<p>It&#8217;s just the price I pay for being a man (if that&#8217;s really what I am)</p>

<p>And I refuse to take it all too seriously</p>

<p>It&#8217;s such a strange activity,</p>

<p>Far too peculiar to be taken any other way</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t wait until tomorrow—do it today</p>

<p>In out in out in out in out in out in out in out</p>

<p>Shake it all about</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now imagine this being sung by the Irish cross between Isaac Hayes and Ian Curtis. Anyway, the lines that I&#8217;m talking about are &#8220;And I refuse to take it all too seriously / It&#8217;s such a strange activity / Far too peculiar to be taken any other way / Don&#8217;t wait until tomorrow—do it today&#8221;. Just to be clear, I am talking about the general sentiment, and not the particular activity he is using it to support. I always forget how absurd everything is, how insane it is that I am even here in the first place. I should have a sense of humor about myself, because I am an absurdity in an absurd universe. I am the bumbling fool, the tragicomic figure, stumbling his way through life, pushed and pulled by chance. And that&#8217;s okay. Because the tramp is the hero. Because everyone roots for Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. Because to root for anything else is to say that doing your best isn&#8217;t good enough, and there is no way for that to be true. So again, fuck it.</p>

<p>P.P.S. The Divine Comedy hits a similar note in &#8220;Charge&#8221;, which takes the <b>Love is a battlefield</b> to absurd and hillarious heights:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ladysmith wants you forthwith to come to her relief</p>

<p>Burn your briefs you leave for France tonight</p>

<p>Carefully cut the straps of the booby-traps and set the captives free</p>

<p>But don&#8217;t shoot &#8216;til you see her big blue eyes</p>

<p>Then sound the charge—breath your final breath</p>

<p>And charge into the valley of death</p>

<p>Cannon to the left and cannon to the right</p>

<p>They&#8217;ll go bang bang bang all night</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll fight them on the beaches</p>

<p>Yes, we&#8217;ll fill &#8216;em full of lead</p>

<p>Fighting naked in the open air</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll fight them in the kitchen, in the bathroom in the garden shed</p>

<p>Fighting the good fight any-fighting-where</p>

<p>So sound the charge—breathe your final breath</p>

<p>And charge into the valley of death</p>

<p>Cannon to the left and cannon to the right</p>

<p>They&#8217;ll go bang bang bang all night</p>

<p>There&#8217;ll be a cannon to the left and cannon to the right</p>

<p>They&#8217;ll go bang bang bang bang bang bang bang all night&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8220;Baby baby, I love the way you talk sense to me</p>

<p>Especially when you say &#8216;Neil, you got love&#8217;</p>

<p>I hear what you&#8217;re saying&#8230;</p>

<p>I have in my hand a piece of paper that says</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s make lurrve, not this phoney war-thang&#8221;</p>

<p>We goin&#8217; over the top -</p>

<p>But you&#8217;re so sexy when you&#8217;re angry, honey-chile&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Roamin&#8217; around in no man&#8217;s land, gettin&#8217; caught in your barbed wire</p>

<p>Baby baby, gonna set your village on fire&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>CHARGE—I&#8217;m gonna hit you where it hurts</p>

<p>CHARGE—So sound the red alert!</p>

<p>There&#8217;ll be a cannon to the left&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8230;And a cannon to the right&#8230;</p>

<p>(The hills are alive with the sound of)</p>

<p>BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG</p>

<p>BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG</p>

<p>BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG</p>

<p>All night!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(It&#8217;s like 100 times better heard than read so do it.)</p>

<p>Ok, now I&#8217;m really done for the day.</p>
