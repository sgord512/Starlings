		<p>That is the song I am listening to at this very moment. Good shit. Cursing to make myself seem edgy.</p>

<p>Anyway as I was saying in the post preceding this one, which was abruptly ended for reasons that are lost to me, I don&#8217;t think many tech entrepreneurs are really that smart. But I cannot really think of many people that I think I would be totally comfortable saying are really smart, as I kind of think that beyond a certain level of intelligence, everyone is capable of getting everything, and to be honest, it is hard to see how anyone could really convince someone that they were smarter in a way that was more than just a magic show, or a demonstration of superior short term memory or processing speed or whatever.</p>

<p>Aside: How did we talk about thinking before computers? How did we think about computation before computers? Did we think about this shit? I should probably know the answers to those questions at least in a vague sense, given my areas of interest, but I am too tired to cross my room, and go find out, and I am really in the zone now, with a wpm rivaling that achieved when typing stuff like my name and test data in programs that I am debugging. I can now type &#8220;Thayer St, George St, Brown St, Angell St&#8221; faster than maybe any other string of that same length, though I intentionally used that string to practice my utilitzation of the right shift key, which had been sadly neglected for pretty much ever. Like, I would just always use the left shift, even when I was capitalizing words that started with letters that were typed with my left hand. I&#8217;m working on it, and it&#8217;s getting better.</p>

<p>Actually my typing has gotten a lot better this year, as I&#8217;ve been making a point of doing small things differently every time, trying to fix one bad habit a day, for a few minutes, and letting muscle memory do its thing. I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ve blogged about this before, but whatever. It&#8217;s my blog, I can do what I want!</p>

<p>Yeah, anyway, I am gonna go to sleep now, because I am intensely aware of my bed about 8 feet away from me, just laying there, asking for me to sleep in it. I was trying to turn that into some kind of sly suggestion, and I don&#8217;t know whether I succeeded. I am hungry now, which sucks, cause I should really sleep.</p>

<p>Too much solipsism in this post. I hollowly promise to do otherwise in the future. Look into my eyes. Do you trust me? Even if you do, I don&#8217;t trust you. Bummer. It&#8217;s not you, it&#8217;s me. You see I don&#8217;t really trust anyone all that much. Just like Kanye, I too can&#8217;t handle the intimacy, and the look in your eyes is killing me. I probably misquoted that.</p>

<p>Nighty nighty, Signing off to the soothing sounds of The English Beat. -Slimy sludge, slippery stairs, smiling faces, smashed watermelons, seeds like stars, strewn across the universe like glitter in a third grade classroom. glitter in the dark of space. Space Jam. Signatories all to the Treaty of Versailles. And we all know how well that worked out, you know what I mean? Fuck it. -S</p>
