	Bad Blogger...

		So I am a bad blogger, mostly because I don't blog all that often. But I'm working on it. I promise. Look, I'm writing right now. Just putting words on the page. Typing. Just took a nap. Now listening to the Futureheads do "Hounds of Love", which is one of those few songs that seems to be able to make me feel a little bit better whenever I am feeling the least bit down. Not that I am feeling down right now so much as deflated. I guess I am just tired, beat down, weary. When I start using synonyms like mad, you know that I am tired. Or something. I'm gonna publish this now, because I want to get the habit back, even if I don't have the content behind the posts yet.
