				What's the excuse this time?
				</h3>
		<p>Well, I did just have finals, an ordeal which included 30 hours without sleep, a surprise exam discovered with two hours notice, an adventure upon a roof, much rumination, a moving day that converted me to asceticism as regards material comforts, a series of bittersweet goodbyes, a round of self-recrimination as I realized I was one-fourth of the way done with college, and had completed so little of what I had wanted to this year. I&#8217;m really can&#8217;t wait to be back next year, to do things differently. That&#8217;s why the blog has been dormant lately. Now, I&#8217;m free. I&#8217;m in LA, I&#8217;m made of time (not really, I&#8217;m actually still really busy), and I have lots of stored up material to share with the world (or whatever fraction of it visits this blog), and so you should expect a torrent, a veritable eruption of content in the next weeks. But now I have to do some more work. Yeah, I know. Sorry. Be back soon, S.</p>
