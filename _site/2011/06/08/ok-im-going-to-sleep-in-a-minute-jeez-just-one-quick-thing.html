		<p>Yeah, I heard this song, and was struck by how wonderful it was: &#8220;Something so Right&#8221; by Paul Simon &gt; You&#8217;ve got the cool water When the fever runs high You&#8217;ve got the look of lovelight in your eyes And I was in crazy motion Til you calmed me down It took a little time But you calmed me down When something goes wrong I&#8217;m the first to admit it I&#8217;m the first to admit it But the last one to know when something goes right Well it&#8217;s likely to lose me It&#8217;s apt to confuse me It&#8217;s such an unusual sight I can&#8217;t get used to something so right Something so right They&#8217;ve got a wall in China It&#8217;s a thousand miles long To keep out the foreigners They made it strong I&#8217;ve got a wall around me You can&#8217;t even see It took a little time To get to me Chorus Some people never say the words I love you It&#8217;s not their style to be so bold Some people never say those words I love you But like a child they&#8217;re longing to be told Chorus The lyrics really resonate with me right now. Just listen to it. One more thought: The following song, &#8220;One Man&#8217;s Ceiling is Another Man&#8217;s Floor&#8221; is amazing, but also one of the weirdest pieces of pop music I can recall ever hearing. It&#8217;s like 8 songs mashed into one. Goodnight. Spencer.</p>
