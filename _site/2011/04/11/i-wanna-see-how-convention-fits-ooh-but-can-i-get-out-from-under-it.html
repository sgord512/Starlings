<p>I feel like standup comedy has backed itself into corner, and that it could be so much better if some of the conventions that are associated with it ceased to exist. I guess I don&#8217;t really see the goal of the ideal performance that I&#8217;m imagining to be most laughs, or best joke or anything, but rather most pleasantly surprising, and I don&#8217;t know a way to articulate this that doesn&#8217;t sound incredibly domestic, and sanitized. I don&#8217;t care about the content&#8217;s being inappropriate or sexual, or whatever, so long as it was told sincerely. I guess that my biggest problem with comedy is the tone that it is so often associated with. I&#8217;m all about sincerity as a moral value, as an aesthetic value, and I hate the way in which comedians seem to constantly be mocking people who are sincere and seem to revel in the sarcastic response.</p>

<p>This is not entirely related, but: I have recently been thinking about who my heroes are. Who lived their life in the way that I want to live mine, who approached the world the way I want to approach the world? Who cared about the things that I care about?</p>

<p>The list is pretty short right now, and there are actually only two names that are finalized:</p>

<p>David Foster Wallace (Tentative) William James (Tentative) Robertson Davies (Tentative) Stefan Sagmeister Mr. Rogers</p>

<p>Why are these people on the list, and why are the tentative names only tentative? I&#8217;ll get to that in the next couple weeks.</p>
