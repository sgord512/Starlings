				Posting again. Regularity soaring, whatever that means.
				</h3>
		<p>I am tired after only two days back in school, I feel as though I&#8217;d never left. I am not unhappy, simply weighted down. I was going to post some new ideas, but I forgot them as I killed time before the writing of this post. I remember now the convoluted path that got me here. I was sitting around, minding my own business like I do on any given day. And then, BAM, I am sneezing like every couple seconds, and there is a tickling at the back of my throat, and my eyes are starting to water, and I am feeling like doing anything but the work that I need to do. But I want to just get something done, and I actually think I will right now&#8230;. (To be continued after some work is done.) Wow, I actually got some good work done just now&#8230; I kind of want to go do more of it, cause that would be awesome&#8230; Oh wow, it is now much later than it was. I&#8217;m tired, and I kind of just want today to be over so that tomorrow can be here. I&#8217;m feeling empty, drained of all energy and initiative, ready to melt into my blankets, to renounce my autonomy and sink slowly into the bed.</p>
