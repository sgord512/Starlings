<p>Good morning Providence and the rest of New England, and may the sun shine upon all your endeavors today.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;ve been in a state of mind recently where I seem to experience little epiphanies on a weekly basis, if not more often than that.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I am worried that I will lose sight of these revelations when I need them most in the future, and I want to have them inscribed somewhere so that I can be often reminded of them. While I don&#8217;t think that my blog is the place for this, I want to organize my thoughts, and so here is a rough draft of my recent epiphanies (also, I recognize that these are going to sound pretty prosaic, but they are here because they have recently become alive to me for the first time):</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is what I had planned to write, and had started to writeÂ  couple of days ago, but I never got around to finishing it, and I can&#8217;t think of an appropriate way to finish it, so I&#8217;m going to go ahead and write something else, &#8216;cause I cannot spend my time doing this. I don&#8217;t know what I am doing at the moment, and I am tired, and I am just about to go to sleep but I don&#8217;t want to go to sleep having not posted anything in a while.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t have many thoughts at the moment, and I don&#8217;t want to ramble on tediously. I feel very heavy, heavy with thought, like I can&#8217;t work up the energy to do anything good.</p>

<p>I should just go to sleep, and I will soon, but I can&#8217;t help but feel as though if I were to go to sleep now, I would be giving up, letting the thoughts that swarm like bees through my mind continue their mad flight all night. I really really need to go to sleep. Ok, goodnight.</p>

<p>-Spencer</p>

<p>(the next post will hopefully be a little more exciting&#8230;)</p>
