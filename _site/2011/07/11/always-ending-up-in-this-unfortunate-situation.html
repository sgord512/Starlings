		<p>I am dead tired, just exhausted to the bone. I don&#8217;t think I can think right now, and I&#8217;m only awake because my laundry is in the dryer. There is nothing else keeping me awake. How I wish I was asleep. This happens all the time, and I feel really stupid for not having been able to foresee this. Ugggghhhhhh. I can&#8217;t even think of a song to mention, cause I can only pay attention to songs now if I have been listening to them a lot recently. I&#8217;m just so tired. I keep seeing myself just falling out of my chair and slumping onto my bed, teeth unbrushed, in my shoes and everything, with music still playing. What am I playing now? Fiona Apple.</p>

<p>Ugggghhhhhhh, Goodnight.</p>

<p>Jet lag is a bitch. I don&#8217;t know why, but this is the worst it has hit me in a long time.</p>
