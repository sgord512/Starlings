		<p>The above quote is from &#8220;People&#8221; by The Silver Jews, off <i>American Water</i>.</p>

<p>I really don&#8217;t have anything to say right now.</p>

<p>I feel like I have the potential to accomplish tremendous things. But I must decide in which realm I want to accomplish so I can get started. That is quite the dilemma.</p>

<p>I should probably just go to sleep.</p>

<p>Part of the reason that I haven&#8217;t been blogging so much recently, is that I haven&#8217;t really felt like I&#8217;ve had anything I wanted to say particularly.</p>

<p>Whenever I have free time, I would much rather program or play guitar, or spend time with people than blog. Ugghhhh.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know. Maybe I&#8217;ll regain my enthusiasm some time soon, but I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m tired, man.</p>

<p>Goodnight.</p>
