		<p>Here&#8217;s something:</p>

<p>I hate that it isn&#8217;t okay acknowledge that any social interaction has more going on than may be immediately apparent. Whenever I spend time with someone, I am choosing to do so, because I enjoy spending time with that person. If I eat a meal with someone, I am choosing to spend time with that person. I can always eat alone. With a backpack and a laptop and headphones, I am theoretically able to never spend any time with anyone. In that context, any social interaction is a reciprocal agreement to spend time with each other with the implicit understanding that the parties in question enjoy the company of the others.</p>

<p>But you can&#8217;t say that. It is unacceptable to talk about wanting to spend time with people without concrete activities in mind. I hate the conventions of conversation that say that social situations can never be explicitly addressed.</p>
<hr />
<p>ten minutes later:</p>

<p>I wrote the above, and saved it as a draft, hesitant to publish it, because I wasn&#8217;t totally comfortable with it.</p>

<p>But that reminded me that I can post whatever the fuck I want to the blog, and so it&#8217;s going up. (How do I always manage to lose sight of this one foundational fact?)</p>
