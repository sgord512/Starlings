				I'm beginning to see the light
				</h3>
		<p>I woke up early this morning, was out of bed at 7am. Tried to go to breakfast, realized the dining halls were all closed, returned to my room, and tried to figure out what to do for the next three and a half hours. I thought about doing homework, but I looked at the problem sets I had, and didn&#8217;t feel like doing them at the time. So I decided to work on my website project, and I started doing that. In accordance with my way of doing things, I&#8217;m getting way too hardcore about this site. My original goal was to get total control over the content of my website, and I thought I could somehow just generate a folder of static pages that I could upload somewhere, in order to actually deploy. And there probably is a way to do just that, but at some point in my research I rejected that approach for whatever reason, and my new approach is to control every aspect of the web hosting/development/deployment/whatever process, and it is turning out to be quite an involved and annoying process, and I&#8217;m having to get into all sorts of arcana that offends my self-image as a big-picture-kind-of-guy. But it&#8217;s too late to stop now. Analogy: It&#8217;s like I&#8217;ve opened Pandora&#8217;s box, and now I have to catalog every goddamn one of the creatures that swarmed forth, and I have to know their whole fucking ecology, and I have to make sure I don&#8217;t get bitten in the process. To bring this back down to earth (as if the layers upon layers of software abstractions are any more concrete), I&#8217;m renting a machine running Ubuntu 10.04 in a datacenter in Newark, NJ. I&#8217;ve spent the last couple hours SSH&#8217;ing into that box (nicknamed spinoza), installing a whole bunch of random packages (emacs, git, apache, etc.), so that I can later run my server on it. I also bought some domain names, which I&#8217;ll have to separately hook up to the IP of the server. As for the site itself, I&#8217;m writing a ruby script to generate the site from a whole bunch of post files written in markdown, and some template files. I&#8217;m also using the <a href='http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/'>twitter/bootstrap</a> css/javascript/html toolkit, which makes everything really professional looking, but which I have to customize to get working in the way I would like. Isn&#8217;t this exciting. Change of topic: <em>The Velvet Underground and Nico</em> is really an incredible album, and I seem to have a new favorite track every time I listen. Recently, it&#8217;s been &#8220;The Black Angel&#8217;s Death Song&#8221;, a spoken-word ramble surrounded by a swarm of eerie violin and tape hisses and clicks. In it, you can totally see the prototype for &#8220;Murder Mystery&#8221; on <em>The Velvet Underground</em> another of my favorite tracks. The lyrics are utterly insane, and I love it: &gt; &#8220;Candy screen wrappers of silkscreen fantastic, requiring memories, both lovely and guiltfree, lurid and lovely with twilight of ages, luscious and lovely and filthy with laghter, laconic giggles, ennui fort the passions, in order to justify most spurious desires, rectify moments, most serious and urgent, to hail upon the face of most odious time, requiring replies most facile and vacuous, with words nearly singed, with the heartbeat of passions, spew forth with the grace of a tart going under, subject of great concern, noble origin Denigrate obtuse and active verbs pronouns, skewer the sieve of optical sewer, release the handle that holds all the gates up, puncture the eyeballls, that seep all the muck up, read all the books and he people worth reading and still see the muck on the sky of the ceiling Please raise the flag rosy red carpet envy english used here is messenger is nervous it&#8217;s no fun at all out here in the hall Mister moonlight succulent smooth and gorgeous. Isn&#8217;t it nice? We&#8217;re number One and so forth. Isn&#8217;t it sweet being unique? For screeching and yelling and various offenses, lower the queen and bend her over the tub, against the state, the country, the committe, hold her head under the water please for an hour, for groveling and spewing and various offenses, puncture the bloat with the wing of a sparrow, the inverse, the obverse, the converse,the reverse, the sharpening wing of the edge of a sparrow, for suitable reckonings too numerous to mention, as the queen is fat she is devoured by rats there is one way to skin a cat or poison a rat it is hetero four hear to three forthirightly stated. relent and obverse and inverse and perverse and reverse the inverse of perverse and reverse and reverse an reverse and reverse and reverse and chop it and pluck it and cut it and spit it and sew it to joy on the edge of a cyclop and spinet it to rage on the edge of a cylindrical minute.
