		<p>Hey, there really is nothing to see here, but I am just trying to make sure I post every day until I get back in the habit of doing so.</p>

<p>So that means I have to have no ambitions whatsoever for the content, and just let it be whatever happens to be on my mind today.</p>

<p>Today, I&#8217;ve thought about the following:</p>

<p>How I&#8217;m incredibly bad at time management. How I need to clearly decide when I am working and when I am not working. How I don&#8217;t think of work I have to do in a way that allows me to do it, but rather I imagine a huge task in front of me, and get discouraged before starting.</p>

<p>Whatever.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m generally in a good mood, though I was annoyed by the rain today.</p>

<p>I would mention something musical, but I can&#8217;t think of anything good right now.</p>
