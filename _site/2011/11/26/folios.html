		<p>Mostly been catching up on sleep. It turns out I had a lot to catch up on.</p>

<p>Relaxing, which has been nice. I&#8217;ve seen my parents and sisters, which has also been nice.</p>

<p>In the little time I have had, I&#8217;ve also spent some time tinkering with my website. I think it is almost ready to publish. Maybe two or three more days of polishing before I have a version I&#8217;m comfortable releasing to the public.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m excited about that. Reading some good books as well. Listening to some good music.</p>

<p>Album recommendation: <em>The New Year</em> by The New Year.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about the way I interact with people, and I&#8217;ve been a lot more confident recently, felt a lot better about just saying whatever I want, regardless of how it may be perceived. (I don&#8217;t go around saying horribly insulting things, so any worries about how things may be perceived are usually needless and detrimental to my ability to participate in a conversation.) I&#8217;m getting better at participating in conversations, as opposed to observing them. Even so, I see myself standing back when I would like to participate.</p>

<p>Ever since one of my many readers decided to read a post aloud to me, I&#8217;ve been feeling really self-conscious about what I write, wondering how it would sound aloud.</p>

<p>I just realized that I&#8217;ve been implicitly assuming that I was the only subject of this blog, and as such, I haven&#8217;t ever really had any other characters in any of my posts. But this is an unnaturally limiting way to be, and I will henceforth have characters. For the sake of privacy, names will be changed.</p>

<p>Wow, I started to do a whole anecdote-type thing, but I&#8217;ve decided not to, and I&#8217;m gonna wrap up for the night.</p>

<p>From the Western edge of the world,</p>

<p>-Spencer</p>
