		<p>Hey, this is gonna be a pretty short post, as I&#8217;m on my way to sleep soon, and I don&#8217;t have all that much to say. I&#8217;ve finally made some real progress on getting my revamped site together, and I should be able to get it up and running within a couple of weeks. Or maybe even something more reasonable than that.</p>

<p>Whatever. Anyway, the title of the post comes from the song &#8220;Chivalry&#8221; by the Mekons on <em>Fear and Whiskey</em>, which is a fantastic album. Other good stuff I&#8217;ve been listening to recently: The Robert Cray Band&#8217;s <em>Strong Persuader</em>, Girls&#8217; <em>Album</em>, Pere Ubu&#8217;s <em>Dub Housing</em>, Sleater-Kinney&#8217;s <em>Call the Doctor</em>, and Archers of Loaf&#8217;s <em>Icky Mettle</em>. I cannot believe how much incredible music is out there, just waiting for someone to listen to it.</p>

<p>Oh, and Aztec Camera&#8217;s <em>High Land, Hard Rain</em>, which I&#8217;m not sure about. I have to give it some more time before rendering my verdict.</p>

<p>Did you know Bertrand Russell invented Type Theory like 40 years before it was explored in the context of programming languages.</p>

<p>Now I&#8217;m going to sleep, so goodnight moon.</p>

<p>Goodnight, stars.</p>

<p>Goodnight, Mars.</p>

<p>Goodnight, folks.</p>

<p>-Spencer</p>
