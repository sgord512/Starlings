		<p>So I&#8217;ve been really enjoying Lucinda Williams recently. <em>Car Wheels on a Gravel Road</em> is a brilliant album, and pretty much every song is fantastic. The title cut is incredible, and &#8220;Right in Time&#8221; and &#8220;Still I Long For Your Kiss&#8221; are two of the best love songs I&#8217;ve ever heard. I have <em>Sweet Old World</em> but I have yet to give it a listen. I want to make sure I&#8217;ve savored this album, really gotten all that I can out of it before I move on to her next one. What else have I been listening to? <em>Wild Gift</em> by X, <em>Country Life</em> by Roxy Music (the one with the infamous <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Life_%28Roxy_Music_album%29'>cover</a>), <em>Horses</em> by Patti Smith, <em>Pink Flag</em> by Wire, and a whole bunch of other junk.</p>

<p>Today, I had stellar time management, and had like my most productive day in years. I went to a cool talk by Ben Fry, creator of <a href='http://processing.org/'>Processing</a>. It was awesome, and made me want to spend some more quality time with Processing, just playing around.</p>

<p>I have this realization every couple of weeks: I am 19 years old. I have a lot of life experience by now. I have a lot of knowledge. I have a lot to offer. I made a vow to do something important by the time I am 20 (as agreed upon by me and a friend, being reasonable), and I think I am on pace to have that done for sure. What important thing I will do is not yet known, but I am beginning to believe I have the ability to accomplish something great, and all I have to do is continue along the path I&#8217;m taking.</p>

<p>For my creative nonfiction class, I&#8217;ve been assigned to write a feature piece (travel writing and science writing both fit the bill, though pretty much anything can be made into a feature with the appropriate angle). Anyway, I&#8217;ve been really interested in the intersection of Computer Science and Philosophy for a couple months, and I&#8217;ve wanted to sort out my thoughts on the subject in writing, so I was incredibly excited when I got the assignment, thinking I could make CS/Philosophy my topic. Only now am I beginning to realize that the paper I want to write is nothing like a feature. While I don&#8217;t have an academic paper in mind, I&#8217;ve been imagining something with far more rigorous reasoning and careful analysis than in a typical magazine piece (not to disparage the quality of these pieces, but they usually have stories they tell, as opposed to ideas that they elaborate on). So I don&#8217;t know exactly what I&#8217;m going to do. Because I really like the topic, but the paper I&#8217;d be writing is for a different class, and would be pretty out-of-place in this class. I don&#8217;t know if I can make a more personal paper out of the subject, and I don&#8217;t want to force anything into the paper that doesn&#8217;t belong there.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve gotten a lot better recently at understanding all my social interactions in retrospect, which is really nice, but I still am unable to understand what&#8217;s going on in the moment, and I inevitably end up confused. Whatever.</p>

<p>Other observation: I&#8217;ve gotten much better at the business of living. The business of going about my day no longer demands my full attention, and I can focus my energies on other things. I&#8217;m confident that I will eat something close to 3 meals every day, that I will go to sleep before 3am, that I can repeat this <em>ad infinitum</em> without anything spiraling out of control. And so now I can pay a lot more attention to what I actually do during a day. And by pay attention, I mean worry. But hey, at least I&#8217;m not worrying about the same old shit. I have new shiny things to worry about!!!!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve gone way over my self-imposed minimum word count, and if I say too much, I&#8217;ll have trouble tomorrow, so I&#8217;m done here.</p>
