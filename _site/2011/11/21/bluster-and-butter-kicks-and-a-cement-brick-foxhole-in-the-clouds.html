		<p>Hey, it&#8217;s me.</p>

<p>The title of this post is me just free-associating. I do this quite often, relishing in striking juxtapositions and weird rhythms. I feel like I&#8217;ve gotten quite good at it, that I can free-associate with the best of them.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know if it is much a talent, at least in this form, but if I could corral it into something more structured, I think I could make something pretty cool.</p>

<p>Whatever. &#8220;Solsbury Hill&#8221;.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m in a good mood, buoyant and queasy, unsettled, ready to fight. And now I have to do all the work that I&#8217;ve put off doing this weekend, but I don&#8217;t mind all that much.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been reading this philosopher at Oxford, Luciano Floridi. He&#8217;s best known for his work in the Philosophy of Computer Science and he is by far the most well-read philosopher I&#8217;ve ever seen. He seems to actually be familiar with the practical tools and technologies used by a programmer on a day-to-day basis, which is rare for a practicing philosopher. When I read his book, I am inspired to read so much more. He seems to be doing philosophy at a different level than most of the people I&#8217;ve been read, and his mastery of the standard analytic toolkit used in philosophical discussion is unparalleled. It&#8217;s hard to communicate what it is like to read his stuff without specifics, so here&#8217;s an example:</p>

<p>I&#8217;m reading <em>Philosophy of Information</em> and the introductory chapter attempts to give some context for the discussion to follow and to sketch out possible approaches to the topic at hand. Section 1.7 is called &#8220;The metaphysical approach to PI <span>Philosophy of Information</span>&#8221;, and is about 7 pages long. In this short section Floridi starts with Plato, and tells a grand narrative of the history of philosophy, leading to the current day, and explains how the philosophy of information can provide a metaphysical basis for scientific realism and semantics without raising the sorts of ontological concerns that led to the breakdown of prior metaphysical schemas. I don&#8217;t know if that is the least bit helpful in making it clear why Floridi is so awesome.</p>

<p>Anyway, I have a lot to read, and I&#8217;m super-psyched to read it all!!</p>

<p>I just spent like 20 minutes trying to figure out how to talk about Floridi, and I really should do the work that I have to do now, so that&#8217;s it.</p>
