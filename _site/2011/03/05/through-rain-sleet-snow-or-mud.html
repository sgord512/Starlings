		<p>I am posting now only in order to keep up my record of consistently posting, so that I may perhaps turn blogging into a habit like brushing my teeth and flossing. It would be lovely if three years from now, I could look back at the collected writings I&#8217;d made, and be taken back to myself when I was younger, remembering where I was and who I was with and what I cared about. But for this to work out, I have to actually keep up the posting, and get it so habitual I almost don&#8217;t even think about it any more.</p>

<p>What are some non-meta thoughts I&#8217;ve had lately? Well, first there is a class of albums I put on right before I go to bed, and though I don&#8217;t know what makes them work for going to sleep, I just know whether or not they will work. Right now, for example, Roxy Music&#8217;s <em>Avalon</em>. The soft sultry pulse, and Bryan Ferry&#8217;s honeyed baritone. The sense one gets when listening to this album that every song is just on the verge of fading out at all times.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m going to sleep now, before I am no longer tired.</p>

<p>Through the soothing sounds of slippery guitars and soft synths, Spencer, signing off for today.</p>
