		<p>So I just finished doing math homework, and I am procrastinating by blogging. During the last two and a half hour study session I listened to a Brahms Symphony, two albums by Big Star, an album by The National, and some undetermined percentage of Stand! by Sly and the Family Stone. Soon, I will put the headphones back on for another stretch, this time reading philosophy. Epistemology to be specific. Midterm tomorrow. Ughhhh. I have grown fond of this particular exclamation, and I think it captures with impressive economy that particular brand of annoyance that one meets at the middle of one&#8217;s assignment. It says &#8220;I am going to have to keep going for some time, and I know it will be okay, but it sucks that I am spending my evening this particular way&#8221;. Look at how much more verbose I have become. Here&#8217;s what happened. I started naming albums, and BAM!, I am in Literary Mode, which means that my words grow like beanstalks from beans (horrid analogy), and I write sentences that test the breath of even the most practiced storyteller. You know that computer science post that I left unfinished a while back? Well, it inspired me to do some legitimate reading on the nature of computation, and the theory of programming languages, and so I am now in the middle of reading an annotated edition of Turing&#8217;s 1936 paper. But, for the time being, I am not going to be able to finish that post. It will probably be better when it is finished. I&#8217;ll post later again.</p>
